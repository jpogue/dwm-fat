NOTE: I've made my patched version of dwm public here for convenience's 
sake - it's just my own personal set up, I have no idea if it will build
or function as-is on whatever *BSD or Linux distro you're using. I'm on
FreeBSD12.0-RELEASE and made several changes to config.mk in regards to 
that so you'll at least want to look there. Transparency needs a compositor 
of some sort running to work - I use Compton, no idea if whatever you use 
will work right. Needs lots of header files and such to build as well, and 
I don't know what off the top of my head so just make clean install and then 
see what it bitches about.

dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
